    "descripcion": "Concierge::Sessions versions from 0.8.1 before 0.8.5 for Perl generate insecure session ids. The generate_session_id function in Concierge::Sessions::Base defaults to using the uuidgen command to generate a UUID, with a fallback to using Perl&#39;s built-in rand function. Neither of these methods are secure, and attackers are able to guess session_ids that can grant them access to systems. Specifically, * There is no warning when uuidgen fails. The software can be quietly using the fallback rand() function with no warnings if the command fails for any reason. * The uuidgen command will generate a time-based UUID if the system does not have a high-quality random number source, because the call does not explicitly specify the --random option. Note that the system time is shared in HTTP responses. * UUIDs are identifiers whose mere possession grants access, as per RFC 9562. * The output of the built-in rand() function is predictable and unsuitable for security applications. 16/02/2026 16/02/2026 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"

    "descripcion": "Crypt::URandom versions from 0.41 before 0.55 for Perl is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the XS function crypt_urandom_getrandom(). The function does not validate that the length parameter is non-negative. If a negative value (e.g. -1) is supplied, the expression length + 1u causes an integer wraparound, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. The subsequent call to getrandom(data, length, GRND_NONBLOCK) passes the original negative value, which is implicitly converted to a large unsigned value (typically SIZE_MAX). This can result in writes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to heap memory corruption and application crash (denial of service). In common usage, the length argument is typically hardcoded by the caller, which reduces the likelihood of attacker-controlled exploitation. Applications that pass untrusted input to this parameter may be affected. 16/02/2026 16/02/2026 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"
