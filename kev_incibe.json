When using an OCSP responder, Tomcat Native (and Tomcat&#39;s FFM port of the Tomcat Native code) did not complete verification or freshness checks on the OCSP response which could allow certificate revocation to be bypassed. This issue affects Apache Tomcat Native: from 1.3.0 through 1.3.4, from 2.0.0 through 2.0.11; Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.17, from 10.1.0-M7 through 10.1.51, from 9.0.83 through 9.0.114. The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: from 1.1.23 through 1.1.34, from 1.2.0 through 1.2.39. Older EOL versions are not affected. Apache Tomcat Native users are recommended to upgrade to versions 1.3.5 or later or 2.0.12 or later, which fix the issue. Apache Tomcat users are recommended to upgrade to versions 11.0.18 or later, 10.1.52 or later or 9.0.115 or later which fix the issue. 17/02/2026 17/02/2026 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"

The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Older EOL versions are not affected. Tomcat did not validate that the host name provided via the SNI extension was the same as the host name provided in the HTTP host header field. If Tomcat was configured with more than one virtual host and the TLS configuration for one of those hosts did not require client certificate authentication but another one did, it was possible for a client to bypass the client certificate authentication by sending different host names in the SNI extension and the HTTP host header field. The vulnerability only applies if client certificate authentication is only enforced at the Connector. It does not apply if client certificate authentication is enforced at the web application. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.15 or later, 10.1.50 or later or 9.0.113 or later, which fix the issue. 17/02/2026 17/02/2026 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"
