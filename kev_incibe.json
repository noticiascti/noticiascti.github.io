    "descripcion": "Open Source Point of Sale (opensourcepos) is a web based point of sale application written in PHP using CodeIgniter framework. Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application&#39;s filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues. 18/12/2025 18/12/2025 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 8.80 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) HIGH"

    "descripcion": "Storybook is a frontend workshop for building user interface components and pages in isolation. A vulnerability present starting in versions 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, and 10.1.10 relates to Storybook’s handling of environment variables defined in a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command. When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable, thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. For a project to potentially be vulnerable to this issue, it must build the Storybook (i.e. run `storybook build` directly or indirectly) in a directory that contains a `.env` file (including variants like `.env.local`) and publish the built Storybook to the web. Storybooks built without a `.env` file at build time are not affected, including common CI-based builds where secrets are provided via platform environment variables rather than `.env` files. Storybook runtime environments (i.e. `storybook dev`) are not affected. Deployed applications that share a repo with your Storybook are not affected. Users should upgrade their Storybook—on both their local machines and CI environment—to version .6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, or 10.1.10 as soon as possible. Maintainers additionally recommend that users audit for any sensitive secrets provided via `.env` files and rotate those keys. Some projects may have been relying on the undocumented behavior at the heart of this issue and will need to change how they reference environment variables after this update. If a project can no longer read necessary environmental variable values, either prefix the variables with `STORYBOOK_` or use the `env` property in Storybook’s configuration to manually specify values. In either case, do not include sensitive secrets as they will be included in the built bundle. 18/12/2025 18/12/2025 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 7.30 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) HIGH"

Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the &#34;Return Policy&#34; configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the &#34;Store Configuration&#34; (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the &#34;Return Policy&#34; field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch. 18/12/2025 18/12/2025 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 8.10 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) HIGH"
