    "descripcion": "Versa SASE Client for Windows versions released between 7.8.7 and 7.9.4 contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the audit log export functionality. The client communicates user-controlled file paths to a privileged service, which performs file system operations without impersonating the requesting user. Due to improper privilege handling and a time-of-check time-of-use race condition combined with symbolic link and mount point manipulation, a local authenticated attacker can coerce the service into deleting arbitrary directories with SYSTEM privileges. This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C:\\\\Config.msi and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques. 20/12/2025 20/12/2025 Vector CVSS:4.0 CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X Gravedad 4.0 8.50 Gravedad 4.0 txt HIGH Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"
