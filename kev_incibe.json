    "descripcion": "filippo.io/edwards25519 is a Go library implementing the edwards25519 elliptic curve with APIs for building cryptographic primitives. In versions 1.1.0 and earlier, MultiScalarMult produces invalid results or undefined behavior if the receiver is not the identity point. If (*Point).MultiScalarMult is called on an initialized point that is not the identity point, it returns an incorrect result. If the method is called on an uninitialized point, the behavior is undefined. In particular, if the receiver is the zero value, MultiScalarMult returns an invalid point that compares Equal to every other point. Note that MultiScalarMult is a rarely used, advanced API. For example, users who depend on filippo.io/edwards25519 only through github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql are not affected.

    "descripcion": "Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad and internet tracker blocking application. Versions 6.0 and above have a Stored HTML Injection vulnerability in the active sessions table located on the API settings page, allowing an attacker with valid credentials to inject arbitrary HTML code that will be rendered in the browser of any administrator who visits the active sessions page. The rowCallback function contains the value data.x_forwarded_for, which is directly concatenated into an HTML string and inserted into the DOM using jQuery’s .html() method. This method interprets the content as HTML, which means that any HTML tags present in the value will be parsed and rendered by the browser. An attacker can use common tools such as curl, wget, Python requests, Burp Suite, or even JavaScript fetch() to send an authentication request with an X-Forwarded-For header that contains malicious HTML code instead of a legitimate IP address. Since Pi-hole implements a Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks inline JavaScript, the impact is limited to pure HTML injection without the ability to execute scripts. This issue has been fixed in version 6.4.1. 20/02/2026 20/02/2026 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 5.40 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) MEDIUM"

    "descripcion": "Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level ad and internet tracker blocking application. Versions 6.4 and below are vulnerable to stored HTML injection through the local DNS records configuration page, which allows an authenticated administrator to inject code that is stored in the Pi-hole configuration and rendered every time the DNS records table is viewed. The populateDataTable() function contains a data variable with the full DNS record value exactly as entered by the user and returned by the API. This value is inserted directly into the data-tag HTML attribute without any escaping or sanitization of special characters. When an attacker supplies a value containing double quotes (&#34;), they can prematurely “close” the data-tag attribute and inject additional HTML attributes into the element.

    "descripcion": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Discovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are unauthenticated. Prior to version 2026.2.14, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs. iOS and macOS used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL. iOS and Android allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin. On a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection. As of time of publication, the iOS and Android apps are alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN. Version 2026.2.14 fixes the issue. Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints. Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins. In iOS/Android, first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU) and discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only. In Android, hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning). 20/02/2026 20/02/2026 Vector CVSS:4.0 CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X Gravedad 4.0 7.10 Gravedad 4.0 txt HIGH Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) Pendiente de análisis"

Normal CLI usage is not affected (`npm i -g openclaw`): this script is not part of the shipped CLI and is not executed during routine operation. The script derived a GitHub login from `git log` author metadata and interpolated it into a shell command (via `execSync`).

    "descripcion": "OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant. Prior to OpenClaw version 2026.2.14, the Gateway tool accepted a tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` without sufficient restrictions, which could cause the OpenClaw host to attempt outbound WebSocket connections to user-specified targets. This requires the ability to invoke tools that accept `gatewayUrl` overrides (directly or indirectly). In typical setups this is limited to authenticated operators, trusted automation, or environments where tool calls are exposed to non-operators. In other words, this is not a drive-by issue for arbitrary internet users unless a deployment explicitly allows untrusted users to trigger these tool calls. Some tool call paths allowed `gatewayUrl` overrides to flow into the Gateway WebSocket client without validation or allowlisting. This meant the host could be instructed to attempt connections to non-gateway endpoints (for example, localhost services, private network addresses, or cloud metadata IPs). In the common case, this results in an outbound connection attempt from the OpenClaw host (and corresponding errors/timeouts). In environments where the tool caller can observe the results, this can also be used for limited network reachability probing. If the target speaks WebSocket and is reachable, further interaction may be possible. Starting in version 2026.2.14, tool-supplied `gatewayUrl` overrides are restricted to loopback (on the configured gateway port) or the configured `gateway.remote.url`. Disallowed protocols, credentials, query/hash, and non-root paths are rejected. 20/02/2026 20/02/2026 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 7.60 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) HIGH"

Upgrade to OpenClaw `2026.2.14` or newer to receive a fix. The fix removes direct local file reads from this path and routes media loading through hardened helpers that enforce local-root restrictions. 20/02/2026 20/02/2026 Vector CVSS:3.1 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) 7.50 Gravedad 3.1 Txt Gravedad 3.1 (CVSS 3.1 Base Score) HIGH"
