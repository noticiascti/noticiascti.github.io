The Henrietta Hankin Branch Library, also supported by the County of Chester, opened in July of 2003 to serve the northern region of Chester County. Our collection of over 93,600 items serves the residents of Upper Uwchlan and West Vincent Townships as well as several other townships in the area. Both libraries serve as community centers, providing work space, meeting rooms, homework and research help, and a wide variety of educational and cultural programs.",
