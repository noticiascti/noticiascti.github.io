Initially providing engineering services only, Simmers became a Division of Pollock Research and Design, Inc. in 1966 and has expanded its' capabilities to include complete engineering services, field services, and materials for cranes, weight handling, mill, special, and category \"A\" nuclear equipment. Providing services both domestically and internationally, Simmers, along with its' sister division Reading Crane & Engineering Co., is an OEM supplier.

    "description": "The Chester County Library & District Center was established in 1962 and moved to its current location in 1980. Largely supported by the County of Chester, the library serves as the District Center as well as the Chester County Library System headquarters. Although we serve primarily West Whiteland and Uwchlan Township residents, our expansive and comprehensive collection of nearly 328,000 items helps to support the other 16 member libraries in the system. The Henrietta Hankin Branch Library, also supported by the County of Chester, opened in July of 2003 to serve the northern region of Chester County. Our collection of over 93,600 items serves the residents of Upper Uwchlan and West Vincent Townships as well as several other townships in the area. Both libraries serve as community centers, providing work space, meeting rooms, homework and research help, and a wide variety of educational and cultural programs.",
