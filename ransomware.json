    "description": "Since our founding in 1991, Summit College has provided affordable, quality education to students seeking new paths. We began with one campus in Colton, California, which was quickly approved by the Bureau of Private Post Education. Then, just three years later, in 1994, we received national accreditation from the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (or ACCET). Our three accredited locations give you more options as you seek to elevate your career. What began at the Colton campus has grown and evolved to become one of the top vocational schools in the region. We established an Anaheim branch in 2003, which we recently relocated to our Santa Ana location. In October 2015, our third campus opened, and we are now proud to offer our programs to students from our El Cajon location. In 2020, we opened our new location in San Bernardino. These campuses allow us to serve the entire Inland Empire region, including San Diego and Orange Counties.",
